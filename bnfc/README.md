The BNF Converter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BNFC/bnfc.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BNFC/bnfc)
=================

What is the BNF Converter?
--------------------------

The BNF Converter (bnfc) is a compiler construction tool generating a compiler
front-end from a Labelled BNF grammar. It is currently able to generate C, C++,
C#, Haskell, Java, and OCaml, as well as XML representations.

Given a Labelled BNF grammar the tool produces:
- an abstract syntax implementation
- a case skeleton for the abstract syntax in the same language
- an Alex, JLex, or Flex lexer generator file
- a Happy, CUP, or Bison parser generator file
- a pretty-printer as a Haskell/Java/C++/C module
- a Latex file containing a readable specification of the language
